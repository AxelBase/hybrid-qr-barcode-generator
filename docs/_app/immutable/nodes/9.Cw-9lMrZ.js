Each level adjusts QR error correction and barcode density to accommodate different use cases and environmental conditions.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Low complexity prioritizes speed and minimal file size. It generates images quickly with thinner barcode lines and lower QR error correction. This setting is ideal for digital distribution or controlled environments where image quality remains high throughout the authentication process.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Medium complexity provides balanced performance suitable for most applications. It increases barcode line thickness and QR error correction moderately, offering good resilience to minor printing imperfections or scanning distance variations while maintaining reasonable generation times.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">High complexity maximizes scan resilience through maximum error correction in the QR component and thicker, more robust barcode lines. This level enables successful scanning even when images experience significant wear, partial damage, or poor printing conditions.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">The error correction capability becomes particularly valuable in physical deployments. Printed hybrid images may encounter creases, scratches, or fading over time. High complexity ensures these images remain scannable throughout their lifecycle, maintaining security without requiring replacements.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Environmental factors also influence complexity choice. Images displayed on screens benefit from low complexity due to perfect digital quality, while outdoor signage or product labels exposed to elements require high complexity for reliable performance under varying lighting and distance conditions.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">All complexity levels maintain identical security properties. The encryption strength, dynamic key generation, and data splitting remain unchanged across settings. The differences affect only visual density and error tolerance, not cryptographic protection.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Batch generation applies the selected complexity uniformly across all images, ensuring consistent scanning behavior throughout large deployments. Organizations can standardize on the appropriate level based on their specific durability requirements.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Understanding these complexity options enables informed decisions that optimize both operational efficiency and long-term reliability of hybrid authentication systems.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Choose complexity based on environment, not security needs.</p></article></div>');function L(m){var e=_();b("1li990r",h=>{var a=w(),g=y(u(a),6);i(4),r(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),v(()=>{f.title="Complexity Levels and Scan Resilience | AxelBase Blog"}),n(h,a)});var t=s(e),d=s(t);i(4),o(t),i(2),o(e),r(()=>l(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(m,e)}export{L as component,C as universal};
