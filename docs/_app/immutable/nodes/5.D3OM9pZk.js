Unlike traditional QR codes or linear barcodes that can be read by any standard scanner, hybrid images combine both formats into a single visual entity with enhanced security properties.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The core principle behind hybrid security is data splitting. The text information is divided into two parts: one stored in the QR code and the other in the linear barcode. Standard scanning applications typically read only one component, resulting in incomplete or meaningless data. This design ensures that casual scanning cannot reveal the full text.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">When a hybrid image is created, the text undergoes encryption using AES-128 with a dynamic key that changes for every generation. The encrypted ciphertext is then split, with an initialization vector placed in the QR portion to enable proper decryption. This cryptographic approach means that even if both parts are captured, reconstruction requires the specific decryption logic and key reconstruction method used by the official scanner.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The visual structure places the QR code at the top and the linear barcode at the bottom with a small gap, creating a unified appearance while maintaining distinct scanning regions. This layout forces specialized processing to treat the image as a single authentication unit rather than two separate codes.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Complexity levels further enhance security and resilience. Low complexity prioritizes generation speed, medium provides balanced performance, and high complexity maximizes error correction capability, allowing successful scanning even when the image is partially damaged or poorly printed.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Batch generation capabilities enable creation of thousands of unique hybrids from file uploads, making the system suitable for large-scale deployments such as product authentication, secure ticketing, or access control systems. Each generated image contains a unique encrypted payload that cannot be reverse-engineered without the companion scanner.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The security model relies on the principle that possession of the image alone is insufficient for authentication. Only devices running the official AxelBase scanner can properly combine and decrypt the split information, providing true end-to-end security for sensitive applications.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">This approach addresses fundamental limitations of traditional codes while maintaining compatibility with existing printing and imaging infrastructure. Organizations implementing hybrid codes benefit from significantly reduced risk of unauthorized scanning or duplication.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The combination of cryptographic encryption, dynamic key generation, and data splitting creates multiple layers of protection that standard scanning applications cannot bypass.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Hybrid images represent the next evolution in secure visual authentication technology.</p></article></div>');function z(d){var e=w();v("1tq17n3",m=>{var n=x(),g=u(y(n),6);t(4),r(()=>c(g,"content",`${l??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),f(()=>{b.title="Understanding Hybrid QR + Barcode Security | AxelBase Blog"}),i(m,n)});var a=s(e),h=s(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),r(()=>c(h,"href",`${l??""}/blog`)),i(d,e)}export{z as component,k as universal};
