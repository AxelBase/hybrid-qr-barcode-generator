This capability is essential for organizations implementing large-scale authentication systems such as product tracking, secure ticketing, or access control.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Three file formats are supported for batch processing. CSV files provide structured data with column selection, allowing precise control over which field contains the text information. The system intelligently auto-selects the most likely text column while permitting manual override through a dropdown menu.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">TXT files offer simplicity for line-based texts, with each line treated as an individual entry. JSON files support both array and object formats, extracting string values automatically. All formats undergo the same rigorous encryption and splitting process, ensuring consistent security across generated images.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">File size limits accommodate up to 100MB, sufficient for tens of thousands of entries. The generator processes data entirely client-side, maintaining privacy by never transmitting texts to external servers. Progress indicators and clear warnings inform users of any skipped entries due to length requirements.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Complexity levels apply uniformly across batch generations. Organizations can choose low complexity for maximum speed in high-volume scenarios, medium for balanced performance, or high complexity when images may experience physical wear or poor printing conditions requiring greater error correction.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Generated images are delivered as a convenient ZIP file containing individually named PNG files. This packaging simplifies distribution and integration with existing systems. Each image maintains unique encryption parameters, preventing pattern-based attacks even across large datasets.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Batch generation streamlines deployment workflows significantly. A single operation can produce secure authentication materials for entire product lines, event ticket batches, or employee access credentials. The process completes in minutes for thousands of entries on standard hardware.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Security remains paramount throughout batch operations. Dynamic key generation ensures no two images share encryption parameters, while data splitting and AES-128 encryption protect individual texts. The client-side approach eliminates server vulnerabilities entirely.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Large-scale hybrid implementation becomes practical and efficient with batch capabilities, enabling organizations to maintain high security standards without compromising on scalability or convenience.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">Secure authentication at scale is now achievable for any organization.</p></article></div>');function A(d){var e=S();b("led0iy",g=>{var i=x(),u=h(y(i),6);t(4),n(()=>l(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),f(()=>{v.title="Batch Generation for Large-Scale Deployment | AxelBase Blog"}),s(g,i)});var a=r(e),m=r(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),n(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),s(d,e)}export{A as component,z as universal};
